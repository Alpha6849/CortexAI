# Cortex AI — Your Autonomous ML & Data Science Engine

Cortex AI is an automated data analysis system that takes a CSV file and performs:

- Data loading  
- Cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Automatic model training  
- Metric reporting  

The goal is to build a modular pipeline that can be expanded with LLM reasoning and deeper ML capabilities in later phases.
